## Welcome to Single Syllabus!

**Single Syllabus** is a web app that converts a student's syllabi into a single, formatted document.

This app is developed by four students at The University of Texas at Dallas: Divya Karivaradasamy, Leonardo Acioli Arruda Sampaio, Saaketh Jasti, and Syed Obaid Quadri.
